# WorldApart

A World Apart is a mash between a Turn Based Strategy game like The Banner Saga and a Procedurally Generated Node-Based game like FTL.

Follow three survivors of the Theseus Mission, sent from a dying earth to find a new inhabitable planet, as they navigate a frozen wasteland toward the rest of thier crew. Together they encouter strange aliens, not so strange surroundings, and uncover truths about the planet and themselves.
